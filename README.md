**ProgressPulse**
This web application is developed as a part of Naan Mudhalvan Skill Development course initiated by the Government Of Tamil Nadu to upskill the engineering under-graduate students. We have compared different regression models and deployed the best one for output evaluation. Recently hyperparameter tuning is also included in order to increase the accuracy of the model.
_Application_ : Flask
_ML Model_ : NumPy, Flask
We have used Inference Client (**HuggingFace Hub**) for deployment of text-generation model into the app. This is included to provide a constructive and actionable feedback to the student. 

Currently, the project will be further upgraded based on the academic evaluation like other statistical parameters will be added.

The server has been down for the past few days due to some conflict in version between huggingface-hub and python, which took a lot of time to figure it out. This error has been identified with the help of ChatGPT and also we have looked upon the latest version of huggingface-hub manually.
